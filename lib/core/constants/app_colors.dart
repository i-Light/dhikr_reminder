/// pieces, "city" colors) from this project's previous life as a board-game
/// companion app. Those were deleted wholesale as part of repurposing this
/// design system for the Gratovo IMA ToolBox — none of them mean anything
/// in an influencer-marketing CRM. Only the generic brand/surface/status
/// tokens below survive, and every screen should reference these (or the
/// ones added here later) rather than hardcoding a `Color(0x...)` inline.
///
/// The brand palette is Gratovo's own: an indigo primary (`#4F46E5`) with a
/// violet tertiary and a rose secondary, over near-white light surfaces and
/// a deep indigo-navy (`#1E1B4B`) dark set. Feature code should almost never
/// touch these directly — read `Theme.of(context).colorScheme.*`, the
/// [GratovoStatusColors] extension, or [GratovoGradients] instead. These are
/// the seeds those are built from, in [AppTheme].
